# Introduction

CADHY is an AI-powered hydraulic engineering software designed for civil engineers, students, and researchers. It combines traditional hydraulic calculations with modern AI assistance to streamline the design and analysis of water systems.

## What is CADHY?

CADHY stands for **C**omputer-**A**ided **D**esign for **HY**draulics. It's a desktop application built with modern technologies:

- **Rust backend** for fast, reliable calculations
- **React frontend** for a responsive user interface
- **Three.js** for 3D visualization
- **AI integration** for natural language interaction

## Key Features

### Open Channel Flow Analysis

Design and analyze trapezoidal, rectangular, circular, and custom channel sections. Calculate normal depth, critical depth, and water surface profiles.

```
Q = (1/n) × A × R^(2/3) × S^(1/2)
```

### Pipe Network Analysis

Model pressurized pipe systems with the Hardy Cross method. Analyze demand scenarios and optimize network layouts.

### AI-Powered Assistance

Describe your hydraulic problem in plain language, and CADHY's AI assistant will help you set up the analysis and interpret results.

## Who is CADHY for?

- **Civil Engineers** designing drainage systems, irrigation networks, and water supply systems
- **Students** learning hydraulic engineering concepts
- **Researchers** analyzing complex flow scenarios
- **Consultants** preparing hydraulic reports
