# Hydraulic Analysis

CADHY provides comprehensive tools for hydraulic analysis, from basic uniform flow calculations to complex gradually varied flow profiles.

## Calculation Methods

### Manning's Equation

The foundation of open channel flow calculations:

```
Q = (1/n) × A × R^(2/3) × S^(1/2)
```

Where:
- Q = discharge (m³/s)
- n = Manning's roughness coefficient
- A = flow area (m²)
- R = hydraulic radius (m)
- S = bed slope

### Critical Flow

For any channel section, there's a critical depth where specific energy is minimum:

```
Fr = V / √(gD) = 1
```

Where D is the hydraulic depth (A/T) and T is the top width.

## Analysis Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [Normal Depth](/docs/hydraulics/channels) | Uniform flow depth for given Q and S |
| [Critical Depth](/docs/hydraulics/critical-flow) | Depth where Fr = 1 |
| [GVF Profiles](/docs/hydraulics/gvf) | Water surface profiles (M1, M2, S1, etc.) |

## Channel Sections

CADHY supports various channel cross-sections:

- **Trapezoidal** - Most common for constructed channels
- **Rectangular** - Special case (z = 0)
- **Triangular** - V-shaped ditches
- **Circular** - Pipes and culverts
- **Parabolic** - Natural channels
- **Custom** - User-defined geometry

## Froude Number Classification

| Froude Number | Flow Regime | Characteristics |
|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Fr < 1 | Subcritical | Tranquil, controlled by downstream |
| Fr = 1 | Critical | Transition point |
| Fr > 1 | Supercritical | Rapid, controlled by upstream |
