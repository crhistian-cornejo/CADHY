Calculation Methods Manning's Equation The foundation of open channel flow calculations: Where: Q = discharge (m³/s) n = Manning's roughness coefficient A = flow area (m²) R = hydraulic radius (m) S = bed slope Critical Flow For any channel section, there's a critical depth where specific energy is minimum: Where D is the hydraulic depth (A/T) and T is the top width. Analysis Types Type Description ------ ------------- Normal Depth Uniform flow depth for given Q and S Critical Depth Depth where Fr = 1 GVF Profiles Water surface profiles (M1, M2, S1, etc.) Channel Sections CADHY supports various channel cross-sections: Trapezoidal - Most common for constructed channels Rectangular - Special case (z = 0) Triangular - V-shaped ditches Circular - Pipes and culverts Parabolic - Natural channels Custom - User-defined geometry Froude Number Classification Froude Number Flow Regime Characteristics --------------- ------------- ----------------- Fr 1 Supercritical Rapid, controlled by upstream Next Steps Open Channel Design - Detailed channel analysis GVF Analysis - Water surface profiles Critical Flow - Critical conditions",

Step 1: Create a New Project Launch CADHY Click New Project on the welcome screen Enter a project name (e.g., \"My First Channel\") Choose a save location Select the Open Channel template Click Create Step 2: Define the Channel Section In the modeller view, you'll see a default trapezoidal channel. Let's modify it: Click on the channel in the 3D view to select it In the Properties panel, set: - Bottom width (b): - Side slope (z): (2 horizontal to 1 vertical) - Manning's n: (concrete-lined) - Bed slope (S): (1 in 1000) Step 3: Set Flow Conditions Open the Analysis panel Set the discharge: Click Calculate Normal Depth Step 4: Review Results The results panel will show: Parameter Value ----------- ------- Normal Depth (yn) 1.24 m Flow Area (A) 6.50 m² Wetted Perimeter (P) 9.55 m Hydraulic Radius (R) 0.68 m Velocity (V) 0.77 m/s Froude Number (Fr) 0.22 The flow is subcritical (Fr \"What if I increase the discharge to 10 m³/s? Will the channel still work?\" The AI will analyze the new conditions and provide recommendations. Step 6: Save Your Project Press (macOS) or (Windows/Linux) to save. What's Next?
